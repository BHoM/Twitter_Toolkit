Query twitter using standard and premium API


Provides access to both the Twitter Free standard API and the subscription based Premium API
Its currently set up to provide search only functionality although could be extended to allow posting tweets and control of a user account
There a a few differences in formatting queries and available parameters between standard and premium which for now I'm relying on any user checking the twitter documentation 
It requires setting up a developer account with Twitter which is a bit of a overhead but you need  to an APIKey and APISecretKey to do any searching
I can provide API keys for testing purposes of both the standard and premium (for which I have a subscription (paid by Buro Happold))
